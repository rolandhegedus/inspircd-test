InspIRCd v2.0.10 and v1.2.10 have been released with lots of bugfixes (including fixes for
crashes) and small improvements.
Upgrading is strongly recommended, the [download links are here](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).

New features to 2.0.10:

- m_filter can now strip colors from the text before processing (new flag: c)
- m_ldapauth allows setting vhosts, and can filter on arbitrary LDAP attributes (see the updated config for details)
- m_operlog now logs to snomask r if enabled in the config

Thanks to all the people for their work who contributed to this release.
