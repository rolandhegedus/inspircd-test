InspIRCd v2.0.12 has been released, you can [download it here](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).

This version brings major performance and stability improvements, upgrading is
strongly recommended.

A slowdown issue has been fixed that caused problems mainly on big servers with
a large number of clients. However, smaller servers will also benefit from the
fix.

To reduce load time, m_ssl_gnutls is now also able to load DH parameters from a
file. Specify the filename in the `&lt;gnutls&gt;` tag, e.g.:
`&lt;gnutls dhfile="conf/dhparams.pem"&gt;`
You can generate the primes using the following command:
`certtool --generate-dh-params --bits 2048 --outfile dhparams.pem`
