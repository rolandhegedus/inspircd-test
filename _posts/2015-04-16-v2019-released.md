InspIRCd v2.0.19 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).
This release fixes the issues discovered since 2.0.18, containing multiple important stability and correctness related improvements, including a fix for a bug which allowed malformed DNS records to cause netsplits on a network. Triggering this issue is non-trivial and it may not occur in all circumstances, but all users are advised to upgrade. If that's not possible, disabling DNS lookups for connecting users (nouserdns setting) mitigates the problem.
