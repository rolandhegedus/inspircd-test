InspIRCd v2.0.17 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).


This is a bugfix-only release, bringing several improvements and fixes for the Windows version, better compiler support and stability and correctness related improvements.
An issue has been fixed that caused m_joinflood to wrongly lock down channels on netbursts in some cases.

Upgrading is strongly recommended.

See the [issue tracker](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/issues?milestone=14&state=closed) for a list of reported bugs that got fixed in this version and for the pull requests that were merged.
