title: Use the bugtracker, please!

Just a polite reminder that the bugtracker exists, and is where all things that
you think of as bugs (or rough corners) should go. E-mail, IRC and other mediums
are always tempting as being "faster" or more readily available to gain
responses, but they are absolutely hopeless for scheduling things and keeping
track of what actually needs to be done.

Don't be too afraid of reporting something unnecessarily: it's easy to close a
bug. It's a lot more worrying that a bug might be going unnoticed because
someone forgot they saw a mention of it on #inspircd.

Thanks!
