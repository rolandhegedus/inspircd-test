Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

InspIRCd v2.0.20 is now available, [download it from the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).

This release fixes an issue with STARTTLS handling which can potentially cause a crash. Only servers using m_ssl_gnutls with STARTTLS enabled are affected, m_ssl_openssl is unaffected. To mitigate this problem, disable STARTTLS by setting `<gnutls starttls="off">`.

Moreover, an option was added to the m_restrictmsg module to allow sending messages to users on ulined servers, which is useful if m_restrictmsg is used with services.
