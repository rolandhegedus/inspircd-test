Hi all,

After a bit of discussion, we've decided to close the 2.1 branch, as the general
consensus is that we aren't comfortable with the state it is in regarding
release-readiness, and unfortunately, the people working on it have more or less
been eaten up by the real life monster.

As a result of this, we're closing the 2.1 branch, and won't be working on it
anymore (it's been renamed obsolete/insp21 in git), and we suggest you don't use
it.

We'll be focusing our efforts on 2.0 instead - and will be renaming that branch
in the near future to 'master' (to more closely match traditional git
workflows).

If 2.0 lacks any particular changes or features you want, then please [open an
issue for them](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/issues), and we'll take a look at porting it.

Thanks!

In other news, I'd like to welcome [@attilamolnar](https://github.com/attilamolnar)
to the development team. He's done quite a lot lately, and the next 1.2/2.0 releases
will be very much thanks to his efforts. Please make him feel welcome.
