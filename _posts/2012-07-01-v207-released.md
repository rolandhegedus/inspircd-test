InspIRCd v2.0.7 is now available, containing a large number of fixes, including
some crash issues. Upgrading is strongly recommended.

Thanks to @attilamolnar for his mammoth effort going into this release - thanks
to his ongoing efforts, a followup 2.0 release will likely not be too far behind
with some less crucial fixes and cleanups.

A 1.2 release will follow shortly with the crucial fixes, but again: it is
reminded that 1.2 is essentially on "life support" at this stage. It is
recieving minimal maintenence, and we do not expect this to last all that long.
I have heard that some of the remaining 1.2 users have issues (whatever they
are) with upgrading to 2.0 - we would very much like to hear these problems
in the bug tracker, so they can be addressed.

A shortlog since the last release (2.0.6rc1) is attached for the curious.
