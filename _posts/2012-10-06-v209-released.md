InspIRCd v2.0.9 is now available, in addition to the usual bugfixes there are some new features as well:

- It is now possible to customize which cipher algorithms are used by the SSL modules 
- CGI IRC users can no longer evade m_dnsbl
- The directory where various data files (pidfile, xline db) are placed is now customizable using configure
- A new regex module based on std::regex
- A brand new module to support server-side topic locking (better services integration)
- m_knock can now send a numeric to the channel when someone /KNOCKs instead of a notice, like ratbox (and friends)
- Extban 'U' that keeps unregistered users out of a channel but not registered ones (see #247 and helpop)
- The "Welcome to network!" notice can be disabled

Upgrading is strongly recommended, [tarballs can be found at the usual place](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).

Once again, if you think you've found a bug then please [report it here](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/issues).
Feature requests can also be submitted at the same place.

Thanks to all the people who contributed to this release:

Adam (4):

  - Fixed Windows build
  - Fix bug #291 - fix rehashing bind tags not changing them between servers/clients and ssl/nonssl
  - Fixed crash in m_mysql if a module is unloaded while executing     a query and there is only one query in the queue to be executed.
  - Fixed issue #303 - fixed Windows build

ChrisTX (8):

  - m_spanningtree: Resolve issue #250
  - listensocket: Fix the two aliasing warnings     m_ssl_gnutls: Fix three warnings:     1. libgcrypt will emit a warning to stdout during runtime that it has not been properly initialized     2. Resolve a warning about invalid narrowing inside a { } block. This is not valid as of C++11.     3. Resolve a warning about a wrong format specifier being used
  - configreader: Replace ConfValue here with a ConfigTagList enumeration, as it isn't guaranteed that bind or link tags are unique which causes Issue #270
  - m_regex_stdlib: A regex provider for the C++11 container std::regex
  - Windows: Replace the unused function hack with explicit instantiation
  - Windows: Use the WinAPI for DNS server retrieval
  - Replace hardcoded paths with configurable ones

  - Don't hard code the branch version.
  - Fix Windows build that was broken by 9b66dd6.
  - Avoid global namespace pollution.

Robby- (2):

  - m_ssl_openssl: Show the SSL cipher used after connecting.     Previously only a fingerprint was shown when one was available, else nothing was shown at all.
  - m_ssl_openssl: Allow the list of available ciphers to be customized.     This patch was contributed almost 10 months ago via IRC, by spender.
