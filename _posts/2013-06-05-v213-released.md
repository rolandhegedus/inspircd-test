InspIRCd v2.0.13 has been released, [downloads are here](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases).

This version fixes a couple of problems on Windows, mostly related to IPv6 and GnuTLS.
Stability problems in extra modules have also been fixed.

The USERIP command (provided by m_userip) has been changed to allow non-opers to query their own IP. Additionally, opers now require the `users/auspex` privilige to query the IP of other users (which is the same privilige that is needed to see real IPs in /WHOIS).

You can check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/issues?milestone=10&state=closed) for the list of reported and fixed bugs (and enhancements) in this version.
